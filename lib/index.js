/**
* Multi-account pool for the Command Code provider (host side).
*
* One Command Code subscription (e.g. the Go plan's 5-hour window) is
* metered; a user with several subscriptions wants a request that hits one
* account's limit to continue on the next account without a visible failure.
* This module owns that rotation:
*
*   - {@link CommandCodeAccountPool.resolveKey} hands out the first account
*     whose key is not currently marked exhausted — or, when the request's
*     model matches a {@link CommandCodeModelAccountRule} and that account is
*     usable, the routed account — resolving each slot's key lazily (literal
*     config key → credential seam → launch environment → the official CLI
*     auth file for the default slot only).
*   - {@link CommandCodeAccountPool.markRejected} records a 429 (rate limit,
*     window unknown) or 401 (invalid key, disabled until the config changes)
*     against the exact API key, so several slots sharing one key share one
*     state.
*   - When every account is marked, the pool probes each key's
*     `/alpha/billing/credits` window limits (through the injected
*     {@link CommandCodeAccountPoolDeps.probeWindow}): an account whose window
*     no longer reports `exceeded` is revived, otherwise the pool throws a
*     `RATE_LIMIT` error naming the earliest reset time.
*
* The pool is deliberately cordis-free (like the adapter): every host fact
* arrives through injected thunks, so node tests can drive it directly.
*
* @module dsh-commandcode-provider/accounts

* weekday, full price) **Monday to Friday only**; the other 17 hours of a
* weekday and every hour of Saturday/Sunday (UTC) are off-peak at half price.
* The V4 Flash Vision (exp) variant (command-code@1.32.0) shares the V4 Flash
* windows and peak prices ($0.44/$1.32) — each row's hover annotation states
* exactly 2× that row's displayed off-peak prices. The picker shows the
* *current* state as a compact
* label (`Peak`/`Half`) matching the English noun style of the other markers
* (`Image`, `FREE`), so a developer can tell at a glance whether calling the
* model right now is cheap or expensive.
*
* Authoritative extraction: the pricing page embeds a model JSON array whose
* hourly-priced entries carry a `timeOfDay` block
* (`{ windows: "01–04 & 06–10 UTC, Mon–Fri", peakHoursPerDay: 7,
* offPeakHoursPerDay: 17, peak: {...}, offPeak: {...} }`). Exactly four models
* carry it: V4 Pro, V4 Flash, V4 Flash Vision (exp), and V4.1 Flash (added in
* command-code@1.53.0 at $0.15/$0.60 off-peak, $0.30/$1.20 peak — the same
* schedule as the other three).
*
* Extraction caution: the rendered HTML rows are a trap. Each annotation div
* sits inside its OWN row's container, immediately before the NEXT row starts,
* so flattening the page to text makes every annotation look like it belongs
* to the model printed after it — that is how `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-fast`
* was wrongly added here (its row is flat-priced at $0.28/$0.56/$0.07 and has
* no `timeOfDay` block). Trust the embedded JSON's `timeOfDay` membership and
* the 2× price relation, never the flat-text neighbor.
