/**
 * Host half of the account-usage Remote (`commandcode/report`).
 *
 * The settings page's account card needs per-account usage, but the browser
 * never holds the API key — the fetch must run Host-side. This module exposes `adapter.getUsage()` through the Typert
 * Gateway: a `TypertRemoteService` provides the receiver the Gateway resolves,
 * and the shared strict descriptor (`src/usage-wire.ts`) is registered on the
 * `typert` registry so the Gateway claims the `commandcode/report` endpoint.
 *
 * The whole wiring rides an optional `ctx.inject(['typert'], ...)` fiber: a
 * profile without the web stack (no Typert registry, no Gateway) simply never
 * activates it, exactly like the web-search provider rides `web`.
